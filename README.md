Project Title: Analysis and Prediction of Walmart Sales


As analysts at Walmart we are trying to predict future sales. There are numerous seasons in which sales are significantly above or below normal. If the company is unaware of these seasons, it may incur excessive financial losses. Predicting future sales is one of the most essential business strategies. Sales forecasting provides the organization with information for ordering inventory, estimating revenue, and deciding on a new investment. A further advantage of anticipating future sales is that exceeding specified targets at the start of the season can have a beneficial impact on stock prices and investor views. In addition, failing to attain the projected goal might considerably harm stock prices. And it will be a significant issue for Walmart as a large corporation. During the exploratory data analysis we will see what factors affect the sales which in turn will provide meaningful insights for better decision making.
